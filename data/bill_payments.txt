## Understand your Municipal bill
Your High Density Domestic/Residential bill comprises of Service Charges which are:-
● Minimum Water
● Refuse Collection
● Sewerage Services
● Supplementary Charges
● Excess water (where water consumption exceeds 5 kilo litres)

For the 2023 financial year, the charges have been pegged as shown below:
US$:
Minimum Water: charged for 5KL @ 1.30 per kl = 6.50
Refuse charge @ 2.06 per collection for 4 times a month incl. VAT = 9.48
Sewerage charge – a fixed monthly charge Incl. VAT = 5.67
Supplementary Charges – a fixed monthly charge = 4.00
Total Service charges (VAT inclusive) = 25.65

Illustration of Bill calculation given a monthly consumption of 20kl:-
(i) The first 5kl are in minimum water – 5kl = 6.50
(ii) Excess Water :- 6kl to 18 kl charge-13kl @ 1.30 = 16.90
(iii) 19 to 20 kl charge-2 kl @ 1.40 = 2.80 19.70
Total Water Charge 26.20
(iv) Add :- Refuse removal charge 9.48
(v) Sewerage charge 5.67
(vi) Supplementary Charge 4.00
Total Bill 45.35

The above bill will be given in ZWL$ at the prevailing interbank rate on the date one day
before billing for example, if billing starts on the 21st then the interbank rate of the 20th is used.
E.g. The rate on 20 January 2023 was ZWL$738.4225 and the current bill will be;
US$45.35 x 738.4115 = ZWL$33,486.9
