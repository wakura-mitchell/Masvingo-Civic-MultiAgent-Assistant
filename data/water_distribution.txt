## Water Distribution – Masvingo City Council

Masvingo City supplies treated water daily, sourced from Lake Mutirikwi.

## Supply Overview

- Target: 30 million litres/day
- Actual: Most residents receive water for ~3 hours/day
- Interruptions due to power outages and aging infrastructure

## Challenges

- Non-Revenue Water (NRW): ~45% loss monthly
  - Causes: pipe bursts, leaks, faulty meters
- Metering Issues
  - Non-standard meters cause billing errors
  - Council proposes retaining ownership of meters

## Council Actions

- Joint committee meetings to address NRW
- Engagement with ZESA to stabilize power supply
